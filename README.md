# accident_severity_prediction
Project Description:
This project aims to build a robust and efficient Machine Learning (ML) model to predict the severity of road accidents based on structured data inputs such as environmental conditions, vehicle types, road types, time of day, weather, and other relevant features. The goal is to classify accidents into different severity categories (e.g., minor, moderate, severe) using various supervised ML classification algorithms.

The pipeline includes:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values using SimpleImputer, encoding categorical variables with LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder, and applying appropriate scaling techniques like StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, and RobustScaler.

Model Training: Multiple classifiers were explored, including:

Tree-based models: DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, XGBClassifier, LGBMClassifier, and AdaBoostClassifier.

Others: KNeighborsClassifier, SVC, SGDClassifier, and GaussianNB.

Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Cross-validation strategies like StratifiedKFold, LeaveOneOut, and GridSearchCV were used for model validation and hyperparameter tuning.

Visualization Tools: Libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly were used for data exploration and insightful visualizations of model performance metrics and feature importances.

This comprehensive approach ensures both model accuracy and interpretability, making it suitable for real-world deployment.

Future Scope and Real-Time Use Case:
In future implementations, this model can be integrated with real-time surveillance camera systems:

Surveillance Integration: Images or video frames from roadside CCTV or dash cameras can be analyzed using computer vision models (e.g., object detection and scene understanding models like YOLO, Faster R-CNN, or vision transformers) to extract features related to vehicle speed, impact intensity, vehicle type, and environment context.

Automated Severity Detection: These extracted features can be fed into the trained ML model to instantly classify the severity of the accident.

Emergency Response Automation: Once the severity is predicted, the system can automatically:

Trigger alerts to the nearest emergency services (ambulance, fire department, police).

Share location coordinates and severity level to optimize response time.

Provide early warning to nearby drivers via navigation apps or electronic signboards.

This future enhancement would create an end-to-end smart accident response system, reducing emergency response time, potentially saving lives, and improving road safety.
